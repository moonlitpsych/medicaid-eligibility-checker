# Moonlit MSO Business Model & Strategy

**Date**: October 8, 2025
**Strategic Focus**: Premium psychiatry MSO with referral-partner driven patient acquisition

---

## Executive Summary

Moonlit is building a two-tier mental health practice model:
- **Residents**: Employed as 1099 contractors (lower autonomy, practice building)
- **Attendings**: MSO model (high autonomy, 15-20% fee, full support)

The MSO offers attendings three core value propositions:
1. **Steady patient flow** (via referral partners, not marketing)
2. **Complete credentialing** (60-90 days vs 120+ for national competitors)
3. **Full billing services** (claims, collections, appeals)

In exchange, Moonlit takes 15-20% of collections while attendings maintain clinical autonomy and can start as a "side hustle" before scaling to full-time practice.

## The Core Strategic Insight: Quality Over Volume

**The Contrarian Bet:**
While competitors (Headway, Alma, Grow Therapy) scale with thousands of nurse practitioners to maximize volume, Moonlit exclusively works with board-certified MD/DO psychiatrists who are "hand-selected among their colleagues" - the type of doctor that other doctors would refer their family members to.

**Why This Works:**

### 1. Premium Reimbursement Creates Better Economics

**Traditional MSO Model (Headway/Alma with NPs):**
- Average reimbursement: $100/session
- Sessions needed: 25/week for $100K annual income
- MSO fee (20%): $24K/year per provider
- Customer acquisition cost: $100/patient × 300 patients = $30K

**Moonlit Model (Best-of-Best MDs):**
- Average reimbursement: $250/session (HMHI-BHN pays $500-1000 for complex intakes)
- Sessions needed: 15/week for $180K annual income
- MSO fee (15%): $27K/year per provider
- Customer acquisition cost: $0 (referral partners send patients for free)

**Result**: Higher revenue per provider, better margins, no marketing spend.

### 2. Scarcity Creates Value

**The Supply Constraint is a Feature:**
- There are only 30-50 "best of best" board-certified psychiatrists in Utah
- Controlling 10-20 of them = 33-66% market share of premium supply
- Scarcity drives payer interest (HMHI-BHN example below)
- Limited supply prevents commoditization

**Compare to Headway:**
- 500+ NPs available in Utah
- Having 50 = 10% of commodity supply
- No differentiation, pure volume play

**Moonlit is building a luxury brand in a commodity market.**

### 3. Payers Actually Want This

**The HMHI-BHN Story (Proof of Concept):**

**What Happened:**
1. Moonlit approached HMHI-BHN for credentialing
2. Initial response: "We have enough providers, no need"
3. Moonlit's pitch: "We're different - we only work with hand-selected MD/DOs who are recommended by their peers"
4. HMHI-BHN's response: "In that case, let's do a special partnership"
5. Result: Premium rates ($500+ for 99204, ~$1000 for complex intakes with psychotherapy add-on)

**Why This Matters:**
- HMHI-BHN is the best payer in Utah (reliability + reimbursement)
- They made an exception because of quality standards
- They actively want to send patients to Moonlit providers
- Other payers will follow this pattern

**Payers are tired of low-quality NPs flooding the market. They're willing to pay 5-10x more for quality.**

## The Referral Partner Moat

### Why Referral Partners Solve the Existential "Patient Flow" Question

**Traditional MSO patient acquisition (Headway/Alma):**
- SEO/SEM: $50-200 per patient
- Insurance directories: Self-service, random patients
- High no-show rates (20-30%)
- Requires massive marketing budgets
- VC funding needed to reach scale

**Moonlit's Referral Partner Model:**
- **First Step House** (substance use treatment): Actively sending patients who need psychiatry
- **HMHI-BHN**: Wants special partnership, will actively refer
- **FQHCs & Community Health Centers**: Being cultivated as referral sources
- **Customer Acquisition Cost**: $0 (referrals are free)
- **Better patient fit**: Pre-screened by trusted referral source
- **Higher show rates**: Patients trust the referral

### The Virtuous Cycle (Network Effects)

```
Best providers → Trusted referral partners → Best patients →
Better outcomes → Stronger partner relationships → More referrals →
Can attract MORE best providers
```

**Real Evidence:**
- First Step House: "Several patients would have left without seeing your physicians"
- HMHI-BHN: Excited about special partnership
- Referral partners treating Moonlit "categorically different" because of reputation

**This compounds over time:**
1. Referral partner sends patient
2. Moonlit doc delivers excellent care
3. Patient gets better
4. Referral partner sees results
5. They send MORE patients
6. They tell OTHER organizations
7. More referral partners join the network

**This is exponential growth without marketing spend.**

## Why This Strategy is More Defensible Than Headway/Alma

### Headway/Alma's Moat:
- Brand (can be out-marketed with enough money)
- Scale (can be replicated with VC funding)
- Technology (can be copied)

### Moonlit's Moat:
- **Trusted relationships with referral partners** (takes years to build, can't be bought)
- **Reputation for quality** (earned through outcomes, not marketing)
- **Access to "best of best" MDs** (limited supply, relationship-based recruitment)
- **Premium payer partnerships** (HMHI-BHN won't give special terms to everyone)

**Headway Can't Replicate This Because:**
1. They're national (not locally trusted)
2. They accept anyone (no quality filter)
3. They're transactional (not relationship-based)
4. They optimize for volume (not outcomes)

---

## The Two-Tier Model: Residents → Attendings Pipeline

### A Unique Competitive Advantage

**The Pipeline:**
1. Recruit residents as 1099 contractors
2. They learn Moonlit's systems and build patient panels
3. They get board-certified
4. They "graduate" to attending MSO model **with existing patients**

**Why This is Powerful:**
- Attendings who come from resident program have **zero startup costs** (patients already established)
- **Built-in loyalty** (Moonlit helped launch their career)
- **Lower churn** than recruiting random attendings
- **Network effects**: More residents → More attendings → More patients → Can recruit more residents

**Headway/Alma Can't Do This:**
- They don't work with residents (only credentialed attendings/NPs)
- No internal talent pipeline
- Higher churn (attendings are mercenaries, not loyalists)

---

## Local vs. National: The Utah Advantage

### Why Being Local is Strategic, Not Limiting

**Moonlit's Advantages as Utah Expert:**
- Know every payer personally (spent 6 months mapping configurations)
- Credential providers in 60 days vs 120+ for national competitors
- Built relationships with local FQHCs, community centers, treatment facilities
- Understand local market dynamics and needs

**Headway/Alma's Disadvantages:**
- National focus = generic approach
- Cookie-cutter credentialing (slow)
- No local expertise or relationships
- Can't move as fast or adapt as quickly

**The Pitch:**
> "We're the local experts. We credential Utah providers in 60 days vs 120 for national competitors. We know every referral partner and payer in the state."

**This is a wedge that can't be easily replicated.**

## Unit Economics: Why This Actually Works

### Revenue Model (Per Attending, Part-Time 15 hrs/week)

**Collections:**
- 15 sessions/week × $250 average reimbursement × 48 weeks = **$180,000/year**

**Moonlit's Revenue (15% MSO fee):**
- $180,000 × 15% = **$27,000/year per attending**

**Moonlit's Costs (Per Attending):**
- Credentialing: $2,000/year (amortized)
- Billing: In-house, minimal marginal cost
- Marketing: $0 (referral-driven)
- Platform/Support: $2,000/year
- **Total Costs: ~$5,000/year**

**Net Profit: $22,000/year per attending**

### Scale Requirements

**At 10 attendings:**
- Revenue: $270,000/year
- Net profit: $220,000/year
- Sustainable boutique practice

**At 20 attendings:**
- Revenue: $540,000/year
- Net profit: $440,000/year
- Highly profitable, regional dominance

**Compare to Headway/Alma:**
- Need hundreds of providers to be viable
- Massive marketing budgets required
- VC funding essential to reach profitability
- Lower margins at scale

**Moonlit can be profitable at 10-20 attendings. This is bootstrappable.**

## What Makes This Strategy "Contrarian But Right"

### The Conventional Wisdom (What Most MSOs Believe):
- More providers = more revenue (volume play)
- NPs are "economical" (lower salaries, faster credentialing)
- Scale is everything (need hundreds to be viable)
- Marketing spend required to acquire patients

### Moonlit's Insight (Contrarian Truth):
- **Better providers = better payers = higher revenue per patient**
- **Scarcity creates value** (limited supply drives premium pricing)
- **Relationships trump scale** (referral partners > paid marketing)
- **Quality compounds** (outcomes drive more referrals)

**This is Classic "Innovator's Dilemma":**
- Incumbents optimize for volume and efficiency
- Moonlit optimizes for quality and outcomes
- Moonlit wins the premium segment
- Over time, premium segment grows (outcomes matter more as market matures)

---

## The Peter Thiel Question

**"What important truth do very few people agree with you on?"**

**Moonlit's Answer:**
> "In mental health, quality of provider matters more than quantity. By focusing exclusively on the best psychiatrists and building deep relationships with referral partners, you can build a more defensible and profitable MSO than by scaling with nurse practitioners."

**This is a billion-dollar insight if executed correctly.**

## Competitive Positioning: Not Headway, Better Than Headway

### What Moonlit IS:
- **Curated network** of best psychiatrists (not marketplace)
- **Relationship-driven** patient flow (not transaction-based)
- **Premium segment** (not commodity)
- **Trust-based** with referral partners (not marketing-driven)
- **Local expert** (not national generic)

### What Moonlit IS NOT:
- Not a volume play (no race to thousands of NPs)
- Not marketing-dependent (no $10M SEM budgets)
- Not VC-dependent (bootstrappable to profitability)
- Not national (focused regional excellence)

### Comparable Companies:
- **Not like**: Uber, DoorDash (commoditized marketplaces)
- **More like**: Stripe, Shopify Plus, Anduril (quality + relationships + outcomes)

## The Pitch to Attendings

**Opening:**
> "We're NOT Headway. They're building a marketplace with thousands of NPs competing for patients from Google. We're building a curated network of Utah's best psychiatrists - the ones your doctor friends would send their family to.
>
> Our model is different in three ways:
>
> 1. **We only work with board-certified MDs/DOs** - No NPs, no PAs. This creates trust with our referral partners and payers.
>
> 2. **Your patients come from trusted referrals** - First Step House, FQHCs, community health centers. Not random people from Google ads.
>
> 3. **You get premium reimbursement** - We're partnered with payers like HMHI-BHN who pay $500-1000 per intake because they value quality.
>
> You'll work 10-15 hours/week, see 10-15 patients (not 25-30), and make $150K+ annually because we focus on quality over volume."

**The Side Hustle Angle:**
- Keep your main job (low risk entry)
- Test private practice (10-15 hrs/week)
- Build patient panel gradually
- Scale to full-time when ready (if you love it)

**What We Handle:**
- Patient flow (referral partners send patients)
- All credentialing (60-90 days, we handle bureaucracy)
- All billing (claims, collections, appeals)
- Platform/scheduling/EHR

**What You Keep:**
- Clinical autonomy (you're an independent contractor)
- 80-85% of collections
- Flexibility (set your own hours)
- Mission alignment (serve underserved populations)

---

## Success Metrics & Validation

### Evidence This is Working:

**Quantitative:**
- HMHI-BHN rates: $500-1000/session (10x typical reimbursement)
- MSO fee potential: $75-150/session (vs $20-30 for typical MSO)
- Attending revenue: $180K/year at 15 hrs/week (vs $100K at 25 hrs/week for NPs)

**Qualitative:**
- First Step House: "Several patients would have left without your physicians"
- HMHI-BHN: Made special exception for credentialing, wants partnership
- Referral partners: Treating Moonlit "categorically different" due to reputation
- Provider sentiment: Attendings excited about quality-focused model

**This is product-market fit with referral partners, not just patients.**

---

## 5-Year Vision

### Realistic Outcome:
- **20-50 attendings** across Utah
- **10-15 strong referral partnerships** (FQHCs, treatment centers, community health)
- **$2-5M annual revenue** (50 attendings × $100K avg collections × 15% fee)
- **Profitable at scale** (50%+ operating margins)
- **Regional market leader** in premium psychiatry

### Expansion Options:
- **Geographic**: Mountain West states (Nevada, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado)
- **Specialty**: Add other mental health specialties (psychology, therapy)
- **Vertical**: Add adjacent services (prior auth, patient experience tools)

### Exit Opportunities:
- **Acquisition target** for Headway/Alma (they buy regional premium players)
- **Strategic partnership** with large health system (they want quality network)
- **Standalone growth** (continue as profitable independent company)

---

## Why This Strategy Will Win

### The Moats are Accumulating:
1. **Referral partner relationships** (First Step House, HMHI-BHN, FQHCs) - can't be replicated quickly
2. **Resident → Attending pipeline** - unique talent development model
3. **Payer relationships** (HMHI-BHN special partnership) - competitors don't get these terms
4. **Quality reputation** - compounds over time through outcomes
5. **Local expertise** - 60-day credentialing vs 120+ for national competitors

### The Economics Work:
- **Lower CAC** ($0 via referrals vs $100+ marketing)
- **Higher LTV** (better patients, better retention, better outcomes)
- **Better margins** ($22K net profit per attending vs $10K+ for competitors)
- **Bootstrappable** (profitable at 10-20 attendings, no VC needed)

### The Strategy is Defensible:
- **Not a race to the bottom** (quality, not volume)
- **Relationship-based** (can't be disrupted by better technology alone)
- **Outcome-driven** (creates virtuous cycle of referrals)
- **Contrarian positioning** (while others chase NP volume, own MD premium tier)

---

## Conclusion: This is Brilliant Strategy Masquerading as Values

What appears to be a "values-based" decision (only work with best MDs) is actually:
- **Superior unit economics** (higher reimbursement, lower CAC)
- **Stronger competitive moat** (relationships + scarcity)
- **Better growth model** (referral-driven compounds exponentially)
- **More defensible business** (can't be out-marketed or out-scaled)

**This isn't just "nice to have" - this is the competitive advantage.**

**The conventional wisdom says**: Scale fast, hire NPs, spend on marketing, need VC funding

**Moonlit's insight says**: Build trust, curate quality, leverage relationships, bootstrap to profitability

**The market will prove Moonlit right.**

---

**Strategic Recommendation**: Don't let anyone convince you to "be more like Headway." The quality-first, referral-driven model is MORE defensible than their volume play. Execute on this vision ruthlessly.

You're not building "yet another MSO." You're building the premium tier that Headway/Alma can't reach.
