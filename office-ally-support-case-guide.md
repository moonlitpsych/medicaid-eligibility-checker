### **Description Field:**

Hello,

I'm an existing Office Ally customer with SFTP access (username: moonlit) requesting setup for Real-Time Eligibility verification.

FAXED DOCUMENTS:
- I already faxed the completed "Real Time Eligibility Request 270/271 User Agreement" to (360) 314-2184 today
- Sheila Odeen directed me to open this support case for technical configuration

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
I need the following to complete my real-time eligibility integration:

1. Real-time eligibility endpoint URL
2. Trading partner identifiers:
   - ISA06 (Sender ID)  
   - ISA08 (Receiver ID - should be OFFALLY)
   - GS02 (Sender ID)
   - GS03 (Receiver ID - should be OFFALLY) 
   - NM1*PR Payer ID for Utah Medicaid

3. SSL certificates (if required)
4. Testing procedures and timeline

CURRENT STATUS:
- Practice: [Your Practice Name]
- Username: moonlit (existing SFTP customer)
- NPI: 1275348807
- Target: Utah Medicaid real-time eligibility verification
- Integration: Ready to deploy (just need Office Ally configuration values)

URGENCY:
This is for live patient eligibility verification. We have a complete technical integration ready and just need the Office Ally-specific configuration parameters to go live.

Please expedite this setup as we're an existing customer with working SFTP credentials.

Thank you!
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **KEY STRATEGY:**

1. **Use "Eligibility and Benefits"** category to get routed to the right team
2. **Reference your faxed agreement** so they connect the two requests
3. **Mention existing customer status** for priority
4. **Be specific** about exactly what technical details you need
5. **Emphasize urgency** - live patient care

## ðŸ“ž **FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY:**

If the web form doesn't get quick response, you can also:
- **Call main support**: (360) 975-7000 option 1
- **Reference this support ticket number** 
- **Ask to escalate** to real-time eligibility technical team

The key is making sure they understand you're not a new customer - you're an existing SFTP user just adding real-time eligibility to your existing services!
