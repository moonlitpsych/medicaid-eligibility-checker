Subject: Real-Time Eligibility Agreement Submitted - Moonlit (Username: moonlit)

Hi Sheila,

I just faxed our completed Real-Time Eligibility Request 270/271 User Agreement to (360) 314-2184.

We're an existing Office Ally customer with SFTP access for claims submission and are eager to add real-time eligibility verification for Utah Medicaid patients.

Our details:
- Office Ally Username: moonlit
- Practice: [Your Practice Name]
- Contact: [Your Name] - [Your Phone]

We have a fully developed integration ready to deploy and just need:
1. Real-time endpoint URL
2. Trading partner identifiers (ISA06, ISA08, GS02, GS03, NM1*PR Payer ID)
3. SSL certificates if required
4. Testing schedule

Can we expedite this setup? We're ready to test immediately.

Thanks!
[Your Name]
[Your Title]
[Your Practice]
```

## üéØ **NEXT STEPS AFTER SUBMISSION:**

1. **Wait for Sheila's response** with technical details
2. **Update our configuration** with Office Ally identifiers
3. **Test real-time eligibility** in their system
4. **Go live** with 4-second Utah Medicaid eligibility checks!

## üí° **PRO TIP:**
Since you're an existing customer with working SFTP credentials, this should be a fast-track approval. Mention that in your follow-up email to Sheila!
