## 🔧 **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **Bridge API Pattern** (Build in reach-2-0)
Create bridge services that connect to medicaid-eligibility-checker:

```javascript
// reach-2-0/services/enrollment-bridge.js
class EnrollmentBridge {
    constructor() {
        this.medicaidApiBase = 'http://localhost:3000/api';
    }
    
    async authenticateFromEnrollment(enrollmentToken) {
        // Connect to medicaid-eligibility-checker patient enrollment
        const response = await fetch(`${this.medicaidApiBase}/recovery-day/verify-enrollment`, {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
            body: JSON.stringify({ enrollmentToken })
        });
        return response.json();
    }
    
    async syncPatientPoints(patientId, pointsEarned) {
        // Sync points back to Supabase via medicaid-eligibility-checker
        const response = await fetch(`${this.medicaidApiBase}/recovery-day/update-points`, {
            method: 'POST', 
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
            body: JSON.stringify({ patientId, pointsEarned })
        });
        return response.json();
    }
}
```

### **Current reach-2-0 Architecture Understanding**
From previous exploration, reach-2-0 contains:
