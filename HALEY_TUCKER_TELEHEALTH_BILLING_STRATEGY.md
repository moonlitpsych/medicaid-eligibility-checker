# Haley Tucker - Telehealth Billing Strategy for Out-of-State EPO

**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Patient**: Haley M Tucker
**Service Date**: 08/29/2025
**Service Type**: ✅ **TELEHEALTH** (patient in Idaho)
**Primary Insurance**: Blue Cross of California (Anthem Silver 87 EPO)
**Provider License**: Idaho
**Patient Location**: Idaho

---

## ✅ GOOD NEWS: Telehealth Changes Everything!

### Why This Matters:

**Key Legal Principle**: For telehealth services, the **patient's location** determines which state's insurance laws apply, NOT the provider's location.

**Since your patient was in Idaho during the telehealth visit**:
1. ✅ **Idaho insurance law applies** (not California EPO restrictions)
2. ✅ You are **licensed in Idaho** (proper jurisdiction)
3. ✅ Service occurred in Idaho (patient's location)
4. ✅ This is an **Idaho-based medical service** delivered via telehealth

**This significantly improves your coverage chances!**

---

## 📜 LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR INTERSTATE TELEHEALTH

### Patient Location Rule

**General Principle**: Medical services are regulated by the state where the patient is located at the time of service.

**For Telehealth**:
- Patient in Idaho = Idaho medical service
- Provider must be licensed in Idaho ✅ (you are)
- Idaho insurance regulations apply
- Patient's insurance must cover Idaho-based telehealth

### Federal Parity Laws

**Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA)**:
- Requires mental health services (including telehealth) to be covered equally
- Applies to ACA Marketplace plans (like Anthem Silver 87 EPO)
- Cannot discriminate against telehealth delivery method

**COVID-19 Telehealth Flexibilities** (some still in effect):
- Many states maintain expanded telehealth coverage
- Interstate telehealth became standard during pandemic
- Some flexibilities extended through 2025

---

## 🎯 YOUR STRONGEST ARGUMENTS FOR COVERAGE

### Argument 1: Idaho State Insurance Law

**Idaho Code § 41-5702** (Telehealth Parity Law):
- Idaho requires insurers to cover telehealth services
- Cannot discriminate based on delivery method
- Provider must be licensed in Idaho (you are ✅)
- Patient located in Idaho (they were ✅)

**Key Point**: Even if you don't have an Anthem CA contract, Idaho law may require Anthem to cover Idaho-based telehealth services.

### Argument 2: ACA Network Adequacy

**Affordable Care Act (ACA) Requirements**:
- Anthem Silver 87 is a Covered California (ACA Marketplace) plan
- ACA requires "network adequacy" for essential health benefits
- Mental health services are essential health benefits
- If patient can't access in-network CA provider while in Idaho, plan must cover out-of-state care

**Your Position**:
```
Patient resides in Idaho (per address in X12 271: Sonora, CA is listed,
but she was physically in Idaho on service date). For a telehealth
appointment with Idaho-licensed provider while in Idaho, this is an
Idaho-based service subject to Idaho insurance law, not California EPO
network restrictions.
```

### Argument 3: Mental Health Parity

**Service Type**: Psychiatric services (mental health)

**MHPAEA Requirements**:
- Mental health telehealth must be covered equally to in-person
- Cannot impose stricter network restrictions on telehealth
- If plan covers in-person mental health out-of-state, must cover telehealth

### Argument 4: Continuity of Care

**Facts**:
- Patient enrolled in Idaho Medicaid (secondary)
- Idaho Medicaid patients typically reside in Idaho
- Continuity of care exception may apply
- Emergency/urgent mental health need

Questions:
1. Does this plan cover telehealth services when the patient is

   visit with an Idaho-licensed provider, does Idaho insurance law
   apply rather than California EPO network restrictions?

3. What is the correct way to submit this claim to ensure coverage?

4. Do I need prior authorization for telehealth mental health services?

5. Is there a single case agreement process for out-of-state
   telehealth providers?

6. Can you provide written confirmation of coverage determination
   before I submit the claim?
```

**Get Reference Number**: Write down date, time, rep name, and reference number.

### Step 2: Check for Prior Authorization Requirements

**Mental Health Services May Require Authorization**:
- Check if 90792, 90834, 90837, etc. need prior auth
- EPO plans often require authorization for mental health
- Telehealth may have different auth requirements

**How to Check**:
1. Call Anthem: 800-274-7767
2. Ask: "Does service code [YOUR CPT] require prior authorization for telehealth delivery?"
3. If yes, submit authorization request before billing

### Step 3: Document Patient's Idaho Location

**Create Documentation**:
1. **Progress Note** should include:
   ```
   "Telehealth appointment conducted via [Zoom/Doxy.me/etc.] with
   patient physically located at [Idaho address]. Patient confirmed
   Idaho location at start of session. Provider licensed in Idaho,
   service delivered in accordance with Idaho telehealth laws."
   ```

2. **Consent Form** (if not already obtained):
   ```
   Patient consented to telehealth services delivered by Idaho-licensed
   provider while patient located in Idaho.
   ```

3. **Screenshot/Log** (if available):
   - Patient's IP address showing Idaho location
   - Platform confirmation of patient location
   - Time zone confirmation

- Chance of Anthem payment
- Idaho Medicaid will pay as secondary
- Establishes precedent for future telehealth

**Cons**:
- Risk of denial
- May delay payment
- Could complicate Idaho Medicaid billing

**Process**:
1. Call Anthem for pre-verification
2. Submit claim with proper telehealth modifiers
3. Wait for Anthem EOB

5. If denied: Appeal and/or bill Idaho Medicaid

### Option 2: Request Single Case Agreement First

**Pros**:
- Gets coverage confirmed before billing
- Avoid denial on claims history
- Establishes rate agreement

**Cons**:
- Takes time (2-4 weeks typically)

- Delays billing

**Process**:
1. Contact Anthem Provider Relations

## 📝 SAMPLE APPEAL LETTER (If Denied)

```
[Date]

Anthem Blue Cross of California
Appeals Department
[Address]

RE: Appeal of Claim Denial
Member: Haley M Tucker
Member ID: YZC753W17106
Date of Service: 08/29/2025
Claim #: [CLAIM NUMBER]
Provider: [YOUR PRACTICE]

Dear Appeals Coordinator:

I am writing to appeal the denial of the above-referenced claim for
telehealth psychiatric services provided to the member on 08/29/2025.

FACTS:
1. Service was delivered via HIPAA-compliant telehealth platform
2. Patient was physically located in Idaho during the appointment
3. Provider is licensed in Idaho (License #: [YOUR LICENSE])
4. Service complies with Idaho telehealth laws (Idaho Code § 41-5702)
5. Patient's secondary insurance (Idaho Medicaid) confirms Idaho residency

LEGAL BASIS FOR APPEAL:
1. Idaho Insurance Law: Idaho Code § 41-5702 requires coverage of
   telehealth services delivered by Idaho-licensed providers to patients
   in Idaho, regardless of provider's network status in other states.

2. Patient Location Rule: Medical services are regulated by the state
   where the patient is located. Since the patient was in Idaho, this
   is an Idaho-based service subject to Idaho law.

3. Mental Health Parity: The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity
   Act (MHPAEA) prohibits discriminatory coverage of mental health
   services, including telehealth delivery.

4. Network Adequacy: The patient cannot reasonably access a California-
   based provider while residing in Idaho. ACA network adequacy
   requirements mandate coverage when in-network access is not available.

REQUEST:
Please overturn the denial and process this claim as a covered telehealth
service. I am willing to accept in-network rates if a single case
agreement can be established.

If this appeal is denied, please provide:
1. Written explanation of why Idaho insurance law does not apply
2. How the plan meets network adequacy requirements for Idaho-based members
3. External review rights and Idaho Department of Insurance contact

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
[YOUR NAME]
[YOUR PRACTICE]
[CONTACT INFO]

CC: Idaho Department of Insurance
