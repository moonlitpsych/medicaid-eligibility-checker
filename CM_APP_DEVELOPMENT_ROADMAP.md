# Contingency Management App - Development Roadmap for Next Claude Code

## üéØ **Project Overview**

**Mission**: Build a complete, self-contained contingency management (CM) app for stimulant use disorder as a subsidiary of Moonlit.

**Architecture**: Single unified app with role-based interfaces (Patient, Provider, Admin)

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Foundation (COMPLETED)**

### ‚úÖ **Eligibility Verification System**
- **Real-time Office Ally integration**: 400-800ms response times
- **Mental health carve-out detection**: Service-specific coverage analysis
- **ACO transition prediction**: Risk assessment for plan changes
- **Production credentials**: `[REDACTED-USERNAME]` / `[REDACTED-PASSWORD]`

### ‚úÖ **Key Discovery: Behavioral Health FFS Exception**
**Critical Finding**: Patients can have medical ACO + behavioral health FFS simultaneously
- Selena Partida case: SelectHealth medical + MH FFS in Davis County
- **CM Eligibility Rule**: Check `MC*MENTAL HEALTH OUTPATIENT`, not overall plan
- **Billing Path**: CM claims go to behavioral health coverage, not medical

### ‚úÖ **Working Components Ready for Integration**
- `api/medicaid/check.js` - Enhanced eligibility API with MH carve-out logic
- `aco-transition-analysis.js` - Risk assessment framework
- Vue.js frontend with Tailwind CSS (professional medical UI)
- Office Ally SOAP integration with X12 270/271 parsing

-- CPSS providers
providers (id, name, credentials, max_patients)

-- Patient pods/groups
pods (id, name, cpss_id, max_size, meeting_schedule)

-- Points and rewards system
points_transactions (id, patient_id, points, reason, date)
rewards (id, patient_id, type, amount, date_earned)
