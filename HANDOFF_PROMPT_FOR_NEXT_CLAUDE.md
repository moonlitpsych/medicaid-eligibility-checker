# Handoff Prompt for Next Claude Code Session

## üöÄ **Quick Start Instructions**

You're continuing work on a **Contingency Management (CM) app for stimulant use disorder** as a Moonlit subsidiary. The eligibility verification foundation is complete - now it's time to build the full CM application.

## üìã **CRITICAL: Read These Files First**

### **1. Project Context & Latest Discoveries**
```bash
# Read this first - contains all breakthrough discoveries
cat CLAUDE.md
```

**Focus on the FINAL section**: "Mental Health Carve-Out Discovery & ACO Transition Prediction" - this is the game-changing breakthrough that changes everything about CM program eligibility.

### **2. Development Roadmap**  
```bash
# Your complete roadmap for building the CM app
cat CM_APP_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md
```

### **3. Working System Status**
```bash
# Test the current eligibility system
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/medicaid/check \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"first":"Jeremy","last":"Montoya","dob":"1984-07-17"}'
```

## üéØ **What You're Building**

**Single unified CM app with three interfaces:**
- **Patient**: Points system, roulette wheel, chat with CPSS, pod communication, video groups
- **Provider (CPSS)**: Patient management, eligibility checking, data tracking, session management  
- **Admin**: CPSS/pod assignments, claims dashboard via Office Ally SFTP, analytics

## ‚úÖ **What's Already Working (DON'T REBUILD)**

### **Office Ally Integration** ‚ö°
- **Status**: Production-ready, 400-800ms response times
- **File**: `api-server.js` and `api/medicaid/check.js`
- **Credentials**: `[REDACTED-USERNAME]` / `[REDACTED-PASSWORD]`
- **Key Discovery**: Mental health carve-out detection works perfectly

### **Frontend Foundation** üé®
- **Status**: Production-ready Vue.js + Tailwind CSS
- **Start**: `npm run dev` (already styled, professional medical UI)
- **Location**: Vue.js files in root directory

### **Mental Health Carve-Out Logic** üß† **CRITICAL**
- **File**: `aco-transition-analysis.js` - DO NOT MODIFY
- **Key Rule**: Check `MC*MENTAL HEALTH OUTPATIENT`, not overall ACO status
- **Example**: Selena Partida has SelectHealth ACO + MH FFS = CM ELIGIBLE

## üö® **Critical Understanding Required**

### **The Breakthrough Discovery**
Patients can have **medical ACO coverage + behavioral health Traditional FFS simultaneously**:
- Medical services ‚Üí Route to ACO (SelectHealth, Molina, etc.)
- Mental health services ‚Üí Route to Traditional Medicaid FFS
- **CM eligibility depends ONLY on behavioral health coverage**

### **Real Example: Selena Partida**
- Address: Roy, UT (Davis County)
- Medical: SelectHealth ACO (`HM*MC MEDICAL`)
- Mental Health: Traditional FFS (`MC*MENTAL HEALTH OUTPATIENT`)
- **Result**: CM ELIGIBLE despite ACO assignment

## üéØ **Your Mission**

### **Phase 1: Multi-Role Authentication & Basic Structure**
1. **Extend existing Vue.js app** with role-based login (Patient/CPSS/Admin)
2. **Add authentication system** - use existing UI styling
3. **Create dashboard routing** based on user role
4. **Integrate existing eligibility API** - it already works perfectly

### **Phase 2: Patient Core Features**
1. **Points system** - database tracking for behaviors (group attendance, negative UDS)
2. **Basic chat system** - patients with CPSS and pod groups  
3. **Progress dashboard** - points balance, achievements, goals

### **Phase 3: Provider & Admin Tools**
1. **CPSS interface** - patient management, session scheduling
2. **Admin dashboard** - CPSS/pod assignments, basic claims prep

## üîß **Technical Foundation Ready**

### **Environment Variables (All Set)**
```bash
# Office Ally (Production)
OFFICE_ALLY_USERNAME=[REDACTED-USERNAME]
OFFICE_ALLY_PASSWORD=[REDACTED-PASSWORD]

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/database

# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://alavxdxxttlfprkiwtrq.supabase.co
```

### **Start Development Server**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend (Office Ally integration)
node api-server.js

# Terminal 2: Frontend (Vue.js app)
npm run dev
```

## üö´ **What NOT to Do**

- **DON'T rebuild Office Ally integration** - it works perfectly
- **DON'T modify mental health carve-out logic** - it's production-ready
- **DON'T ignore the behavioral health discovery** - it's the key insight
- **DON'T create separate apps** - extend the existing Vue.js foundation

## üìû **What to Ask User For**

### **Office Ally SFTP Credentials**
User has working SFTP connection for claims submission - ask for:
- Current directory structure  
- File format requirements
- Test access to verify it still works

### **Specific CM Program Requirements**
- Cash reward system integration details
- Utah Medicaid compliance requirements  
- Video conferencing preferences

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

### **Technical**
- Role-based authentication working
- Patient points system functional
- Basic chat between patients and CPSS
- Claims preparation dashboard for admin

### **Business**  
- Accurate CM eligibility using mental health carve-out logic
- Streamlined CPSS workflow for patient management
- Admin tools for pod assignments and claims

## üìÅ **Key Files to Examine**

```bash
# Core eligibility system (working - study but don't break)
api/medicaid/check.js
aco-transition-analysis.js
investigate-selena-dual-coverage.js

# Frontend foundation (extend this)
src/App.vue
src/components/

# Environment config
.env.local

# API server (working - extend with CM features)
api-server.js
```

## ‚ö° **Quick Verification**

Before starting development, verify the foundation:

1. **Test eligibility API**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/medicaid/check \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"first":"Selena","last":"Partida","dob":"1999-02-19"}'
   ```

2. **Check mental health carve-out detection** - should show CM eligible despite SelectHealth ACO

3. **Start frontend** - should see professional medical UI at `http://localhost:5173`

**The hardest part (Office Ally integration + mental health carve-out logic) is DONE. Now build the CM app on this solid foundation!** üöÄ
